# Steganography-Challenge
# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography Challenge Lab

This repository contains my work on Steganography challenges — a core technique used in cybersecurity, CTFs, digital forensics, and hidden communication. The goal of this lab is to extract concealed information from media files such as images, audio, and documents using various steganographic tools and methods.

# 📌 Objective

The purpose of this lab is to:

Understand how data can be secretly embedded in files

Identify visual and non-visual indicators of hidden content

Use forensic and steganography tools to extract concealed messages

Strengthen practical skills in solving CTF stego challenges

# 🛠 Tools and Techniques Used
Category	Tools / Commands	Usage
Metadata Analysis	exiftool, strings	Inspect metadata, hidden text
Image Steganography	steghide, zsteg, stegcracker	Extract embedded data from images
Binary/Hex Analysis	binwalk, xxd	Detect hidden files or appended data
Encoding/Decoding	base64, hex, ROT cipher tools	Decode recovered text
Audio Steganography (if applicable)	stegano, spectrogram analysis	Reveal waveform-based hidden messages
# 🔍 Approach
